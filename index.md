Since graduating from Lewis & Clark College with a CS degree, I've worked as a mobile developer in Latin America and domestically. I've lived and worked in San JosÃ© Costa Rica ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡·, Lima PerÃº ğŸ‡µğŸ‡ª, and Mexico City ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡½

In 2023 I moved to San Francisco and have grown passionate about surfing (namely body and mat surfing).
