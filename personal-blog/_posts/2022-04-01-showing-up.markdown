This is the inaugural post of my blog and I wanted to highlight some wisdom that I revisited today.

> Showing up is 80% of life. – [Woody Allen][woody-allen]{{ site.blank-target }}

This is a popular adage among my mother's generation and I credit her with sharing it with me. You might hear variations of it that replace the word *life* with *success*.

I prefer *life* because it feels more individual — we get to make choices to shape our own lives. Whereas *success* invokes criteria impressed upon us by our upbringing and society. And depending on what criteria you've internalized, *success* might be overrated.

I *showed up* in a very literal sense today. I attended a [Running Mafia][running-mafia]{{ site.blank-target }} track workout at 6 am. When my alarm went off I contemplated the two fundamental questions that make *showing up* difficult:

1. Will it be worthwhile?
2. Am I capable?

I knew very little about the group beforehand. I'm confident in my ability to run but less confident in my ability to communicate in Spanish and navigate Mexican culture. I made it out the door with these answers:

1. Will it be worthwhile?
  - *I don't know. It's ok if it's not. Not every experience needs to be optimized to oblivion.*
2. Am I capable?
  - *I don't know. Even if I feel incapable, showing up is the best way to become more capable. Have some [grit][grit-wiki]{{ site.blank-target }}.*

I found the group at the [track][plan-sexenal]{{ site.blank-target }}. I chatted with the coach, Alejandro. My intermediate Spanish held up! He started me off with 400m repeats at 85 seconds. I wound it down to 75 seconds by the 7th interval.

For the last interval, Alejandro paced me for the first 250m. As instructed, I kicked the remaining 150m for a time of 71 seconds. This was followed by stretching and strengthening that exposed my lack of flexibility and general strength.

This is why you *show up*. There is so much for me to gain from this group. Not just running fitness but an opportunity to improve my Spanish and have a team.

I moved to Mexico City in August of 2021 and boy did I have to *show up* for that too. Like this morning I didn't know what to expect, and I had doubts about whether living here was sustainable. But my experience today affirms my choice to move to Mexico City. *Soy capaz.*

Mexico City is full of people who are passionate about their interests and place community over the individual in a way that is very rare in the United States. I'd like to cultivate this mindset and *show up* for others.

I have friends here who support me. I have opportunities to learn and grow. I just have to be willing to *show up* and participate.
