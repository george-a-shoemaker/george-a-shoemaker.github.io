\~or\~ how to acquire vocabulary in a foreign language.

I'm in my 4th week of training with [Running Mafia][running-mafia]{{ site.blank-target }} and it's going great! As a foreigner in Mexico, I have to use Spanish to participate which is not a chore but an opportunity to acquire more language. Here are some words I've learned.

[I plan to make this a living repository for running related terminology]

- ritmo : pace
- fuerza : strength
- estiramientos : stretches
- tecnica : techique / drills
- calientamiento : warm up
- parciales : splits
- vuelta : lap
- bailarina : [carioca][carioca] (the drill, not karaoke)
- cinturon : hips (literally belt)
- plancha : plank exercise
- los tenis : athletic shoes / sneakers
- me cuesta : it's difficult
- cono : cone
- plato / platillo : flat cone
- cientos : strides (literally 100s)
- coach / entrenador : coach
- prueba : time trial 
- descanso (activo) : (active) rest, long term sense
- recuperación : rest (between repetitions), short term sense
- trote / trotear : jog
- acostarse : lay down
- boca abajo : face down
- programa : program
- zona cardiadica : heart rate zone
- va : ok

Listing out words like this is problematic to you, the reader. I don't think memorizing lists of words is very effective.

## The problem with vocab lists

A list encourages you to map the Spanish word to an approximately equivalent English word. This is less than ideal because you can't directly reference what Spanish words *mean*. To get at the meaning of the Spanish word you must remember the English mapping and consider what the English word means.

> [Spanish] ↔ [English] ↔ [MEANING]

This causes two problems:
- Referencing the English word is cognitively difficult and slow. Trying to "translate" in your head will inhibit you from keeping up in real-time conversations.
- Some words have approximate translations at best. This means that the meaning behind your English mapping isn't quite right which leads to misunderstanding.

So what's the better strategy?

## A better way to learn

To produce the list above, I didn't google anything. I considered the direct meaning of these Spanish words and mapped the *meaning* to English approximations.

> [Spanish] ↔ [MEANING] ↔ [English] 

To learn words this way you need to have meaningful experiences with the language in context. An easy way to do this is to consume podcasts / tv / movies because hopefully the narrative & topics are engaging and meaningful. The media iteself builds up context that allows you to derive the meaning of words.

In my case, I'm learning in a group of Spanish speakers while doing a familiar activity: competive running. I have a wealth of context and embodied knowledge in this environment, but the language is foreign.

So to learn some Spanish all I need to do is listen to what's being said and try to map those words to the context of the moment. For example I was stuck on how to say "splits" in the context of running (i.e. a measurment of time at an intermeidate distance). I rememember when the coach said the equivalent word: "parciales". And it's stuck with me. 

In fact there are many words in Spanish where I can remember the exact situation where I learned it. That's what you want. Words triggering past experiences. Or familiar experiences conjuring words. It's just so much faster and more intuitive than slogging through translations.
