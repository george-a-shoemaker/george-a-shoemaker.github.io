I am mediocre at surfing boards -- my preference is to body or mat surf. However I've taken (board) surf lessons so I know the basics.

My friend Morgan is rolling thru SF and wants to try surfing. Today we swam at the Aquatic Park in SF and she is competent in open water. So why not surf Linda Mar Beach in Pacifica? The ideal beginner's beach complete with a Taco Bell!

## The lesson plan

This is how I think the lesson will go. It will be interesting to see if my vision pans out.

### On beach

#### 1. Paddling demo
- Arched back, your weight should be on the bottom of your rib cage.
- Controlled, purposeful strokes
- Push down on the board to get through waves
- "Turtling" the board is an option
- Stay with your board if you can. Only ditch the board if no one is behind you
- Find a fore-and-aft reference point. With arms reaching forward, line lining up your finger tips with a specific point such as a lump of wax, ding, etc.. Try to adjust this position as needed & return to it consistantly. There are many variables in surfing but this one that can be controlled.

#### 2. Stretch + observe the waves ~10 minutes
- Can you identify the period (the time between each wave)? Can you identify a set (the biggest waves you can expect)?
- Can you spot any rip currents? They might be where no waves are breaking. Rips are dangerous for weak swimmers but useful to surfers trying to get beyond the breakers.
- Can you identify a good peak (the point where a wave begins to break)? Can you visualize riding the wave or see how other surfers are succeeding or failing on the wave?

#### 3. Pop-up talk
**Prerequisite:** Are you balanced while lying on the board? Are your finger tips lined up with your fore-and-aft reference point? Is the nose of the board pointing at the beach?

**Step 0, Paddle**: *[I elaborate on this step below]* For a beginner this is should be managed by the instructor who will push the student into a wave.

	With a wave coming you should be pointing at the beach, ready to paddle, positioned well and look over your shoulder. You want to gauge what the wave is doing, judging how much you need to paddle, identifying if the peak is to your left or right and aware of other surfers that might have priority. Sometimes you need to paddle more to not miss the wave. Sometimes you need not paddle hardly at all and risk paddling to deep. It's a beginner mistake to paddle like a maniac every time without awareness of what the wave is actually doing. Catching a wave is about timing and position over sheer paddling strength. The ultra-strong Kelly Slater-types need a lot of strength because the boards themselves are difficult to paddle and are optimized for turning performance over plaining / paddle speed.

**Step 1**: Cobra. Plant hands under shoulder sockets, arch back and press into your knees. Feel the "lift" of the wave which is an indicator that you've caught it. Pressing into your knees and therefore the tail of the board should help you catch the wave.

> Physics aside: At face value the cobra position helps you keep the nose from plunging into the water as the wave steepens... but it also helps you catch the wave better. If you press your weight into the tail through your knees the, the tail experiences two opposing forces: gravity pushing down and the wave pushing up. The board has nowhere to go but forward and will accelerate! I must credit [Ombe Surf](https://www.youtube.com/@ombesurf) on youtube for this concept which they call "Oreo Biscuit" (squeeze the back of an oreo cookie, and the veggie oil filling has nowhere to go but forward).

**Step 2**: Place your back foot and "tripod". The key is that you are pressing into the board symmetrically with hands evenly spaced under shoulder sockets and your back foot pressing into the center of the board.

**Step 3**: Place your front foot and stay low. Point your knees and shoulders in the direction of travel (Now you're surfing!)

Of course there are more dynamic ways to pop up on a surfboard but that requires many hours of experience to figure out and then commit to muscle memory.

In my experience it's best to take your time and count out each step... 1. Cobra when the wave catches (observe the "lift" sensation for a moment) 2. Tripod 3. Step forward and stay low

==========================

## How the lesson went: Very well!

2023-10-23

A suprising sentiment from Morgan the test subject: "Way more fun than snowboarding!". Surprising because most beginners (myself included) quickly realize that surfing involves a lot of paddling and coping with the chaos of breaking waves just to get into position. So I was doing my job effectively as the instructor by managing those challenges and letting Morgan focus on the fun part: catching waves and standing up.

### Specifics of the lesson

1. Morgan is hella athletic: She was a collegiate heptathlete (Track & Field discipline that is 7 combined events) and is street skateboarder. She also has experience swimming in the open ocean as a child.
2. Conditions at Linda Mar were 4ft set waves, a bit big for beginners, with a 10 second period. This meant I spent most of the time with her in the white wash, quickly turning her around, and immediately pushing her into the next broken wave. A bit hectic but such is surfing -- waves wait for no one.
3. I was in the water if swim fins. This means I have a lot of "hands free" thrust and mobility. I could really easily body surf back to Morgan after she caught a wave. Ocean swim fins (Yucca, DaFin) are a great tool.

### What I learned about teaching surfing

#### Managing the student's board
I found two ways to manage Morgan's board as we negotiated the relentless white water:

1. Grab the nose and toe your student, mostly relying on the fins to kick under the board.
	- Pros: You can face the student and talk them directly. When a wave comes you can maintain good purchase on the board as the tail lifts while you sink. This helps to anchor them and keep them from getting pushed backwards.
	- Cons: It can be tiring to pull a board this way. Going over bigger waves it might be counterproductive to weight the nose of the board.
2. [Prefferred method] Push the student from the tail of the board, mainting an extended rigid arm.
	- Pros: You can propel the student more efficiently this way, using one arm to take strokes if you want. You have more leverage to change their angle quickly from the rear.
	- If you don't maintain a rigid arm you might get bonked in the head by the board or the student's foot. Harder to communicate with the student from behind.

#### Awareness of fear

Being in tune with your fear as a surfer is critical. As an instructor you need to additionally gauge your student's fear which requires effort and observation.

I myself use fear as a gauge for judging my position relative to a wave. An unbroken wave might be large, 5ft+, but if it's not standing up, forming an imposing wall ready to throw (a scary thing to see coming at you), I know I have no chance at catching it!

What's hardly scary to you might be terrifying to your student. Also the experience of wiping out and getting tumbled can induce panic without some experience of what to expect. Inducing panic might slam the door on surfing for your student so I think baby steps and positive experiences are important.

I was confident that Morgan could recover from a wipe out and retrieve her board, because I saw her open water swim skills the day before. If you perceive that your student is *not* a strong swimmer, you should be extremely selective about the conditions you enter the water with them (or simply choose not to get in with them).

Once I saw Morgan surface from a wipeout with eyes wide open, fight or flight mode. Not everyone can handle that. And at least once she asked to take a break while were getting pummled by white wash. When I do another lesson, I will encourage this from the student: tell me when you're overwhelmed or need a break sooner rather than later. Surfing is about navigating fear, not being overhwelmed by it (which is a likely indication that the situation has become dangerous).

### Next steps for Morgan

Ideally we'd go out with the same board (8ft foam top) on a slightly smaller day. Morgan spent nearly 3h in the water, the latter half of which I left her to her own devices. The waves were too big for her to paddle out on her own. And the few times I assisted her out the back, they were not realistic for her to catch green -- too big, too fast.

If Morgan didn't submerge the nose on take-off, she was standing nearly all the time (major bravo!!). So I think that means she's ready to delve into the details of **Step 0, Paddle** which is it's own protocol to be drilled:

**Paddling for a wave (Step 0 of Pop-Up)**:

Once you've paddled out the back, you should generally be sitting up on the board, parallel to the beach, watching for waves.

<ol type="a">
  <li>When you've identified an approaching wave, pivot the board to face the beach and assume your prone starting position. This is something you must drill for consistency. Really competent surfers can do this step in a second without thinking.</li>
  <li>Look over your shoulder to identify where you think the peak will be (over your left or right shoulder). Gauge how much you need to paddle. Consider paddling towards the peak to capture more wave-catching energy.
<li>As the wave is about to reach you consider angling your board away from the peak (going left or right) to help you set a line and trim down the wave once you've popped up.</li>
<li>All the while keep an eye out for other surfers that might have priority. To pull-out at this time, sit up on the board and sink the tail to let the wave pass.</li>
<li>Take your last strokes with purpose as the wave starts sucking and initiate the pop-up <b>Step 1</b> when you feel the "lift" of the wave.</li
</ol>


These steps are far more woo-woo than that pop-up itself. It requires experiene and observation to successfully gauge whether you have a chance to catch a wave vs being too deep and wiping out.

No two waves in the ocean are exactly the same which makes learning to make waves and stand up even harder. It requires observation of waves breaking and the sensation of catching a wave combined with efficient and purposeful movements executed at the right time.

When I was a surf student, the instructor would get progressively more hands off until I was catching waves under my own power, all the while shouting instructions to help the student time their movements correctly: "REMA, REMA!" (paddle in Spanish), "UP!".

## I don't want to be Kelly Slater

Traditionally in Hawaii kids start out swimming, then body surfing, then maybe progress to a [paipo](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/paipo) before graduating to standing boards. This is closer to my own journey into surfing which began with swimming and a nameless intuition to body surf before I realized that was an activity in and of itself.

It seems that for many beginner board surfers (myself included) there is a pipeline (no pun intended) from the lesson I've described using a big stable log, to smaller zippier boards and radical turns, aspiring to emulate competition surfers like Kelly Slater. But that Kelly Slater *image* is just a tiny fraction of what surfing can be. There are so very many ways to catch waves that branch out in all directions, and feeling like you have to be a short boarder might suck the fun out of it.

And because the apparent "learn to surf" pipeline begins with boards, it's as if body surfing, mats, boogie boards and swimming itself don't "count" when I think they really do!

I am a *surfer*. Rarely do I surf on a board but I have deep experiental knowledge of *catching waves*.

## Make sure they have fun

After getting Morgan to stand up on her board a few times, we took a break and I stuck her in fins and towed her out on the surf mat. A decent four foot wave arrived and I told her to just hold on and she rode it all the way to the beach laughing her ass off. Yep that's the magic of surf mats. It takes a minute to learn and a lifetime to master -- always chasing the next thrill by pushing the limits of what you can do.

Morgan was committed to drilling her board skills the rest of the day which is great. I imagine a weaker student that was not having fun would really benefit from a few laps on the mat or some gentler experiences body surfing in the shallows.

I think the sensation of "catching" a wave, exploiting the crescendo of energy at just the right moment, dodging the potential violence of a crashing lip, is a universally joyous experience regardless of the craft.

So if you teach someone to surf, priority number 1 is to grant your student the keys to that magical sensation -- *skills, protocols and boards be damned.*
